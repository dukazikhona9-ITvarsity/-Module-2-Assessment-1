             <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
             <p>Elephants are a select group of proboscideans belonging to the family Elephantidae. They are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and they're the world's largest land animal. The African elephant is the world's largest land mammal – with males on average measuring up to 3m high and weighing up to 6 tonnes. Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that's well over half their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years.Elephants are fascinating creatures. Being the largest of all land mammals on Earth, many aspects of their huge anatomy are a source of amazement themselves, whilst their high level of social development makes them an intriguing subject for observation. Furthermore, we are increasingly learning that they play a vital role in the natural environment, and in maintaining the balance of fragile ecosystems. Unfortunately however, decades of negative interactions with humans have reduced the numbers of these gentle giants significantl.</p>
             <p>Elephants walk at about 4mph, and they are able to swim long distances. They are, however, the only mammal which can’t jump. How fast can elephants run? Elephants have been clocked to run at 15 mph, however it is believed that, over a very short sharp distance, elephants could run as fast as 25mph.
                Adult elephants spend about 16 hours a day eating – they require up to 300kg of food and 160 litres of water each dayAn elephant’s trunk is a very impressive multi-tool. Besides being a long nose used for smelling, breathing and trumpeting, it is also used as a hand to grab things – it is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass, and strong enough to rip the branches off a tree. The trunk is also used as a huge straw – elephants can suck up to 14 litres of water a time into their trunks and then blow this water into their mouths to drink. When bathing, they also use their trunk to spray themselves with water and mud. A great pub quiz question is how many muscles in an elephant’s trunk? Amazingly the answer is 40,000!</p>
             <p><strong> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
             <p>You will find elephants at the pen E22,right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
