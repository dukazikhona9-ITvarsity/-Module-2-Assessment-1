             <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
             <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
             <p>The typical gestation period is five to six months. When they are about to give birth, sows temporarily leave their families to farrow in a separate hole. The litter is 2–8 piglets, with 2–4 typical. The sow will stay in the hole for several weeks, nursing her piglets.</p>
             <p><strong> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
             <p>You will find warthogs to the west side.</p>
